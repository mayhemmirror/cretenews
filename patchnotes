Combat

Range armor damage in Adrenaline reduced from x5 to x3.
Melee armor damage in Adrenaline increased from x2 to x3 (Now Melee and Range adrenaline vs armor bonus is the same, making Melee extra powerful against armor).
Range energy base recovery is now weighted. From being only based on base damage, now is 3/4 based damage, 1/4 final damage. This will make energy recovery more powerful when enemies receive more final damage (after mitigations such as skin, metal skin, armor, and other).

Leaderboards

Added number of players.

Level design

Removed some legacy doors in some rooms.

Fixes

Potential fixes to improve fps in Tartarus. This is not yet guaranteed, but it is the first of many steps.
Fixed a bu where you could accidentally delete the wrong design if you sort them by name first.
Now the sort by stays after deleting a design.
