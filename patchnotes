New patch in experimental CRETE, Remember to reset your Steam client to get the latest updates. 

You can always check the experimental version by doing this: Steam CRETE app > properties > Betas > and select "experimentalcrete"  so you can access the experimental branch. :kill: 

**IMPORTANT** You need to reapply your weapons in a weapon selector; otherwise, bugs may appear related to cooldowns.

- All abilities now have variable energy ratios (cooldowns). Soon will be added to the ability description cards.
- If an ability socket is not fully filled, now it will slowly decrease the charge until reaching 0. Abilities fully loaded will stay usable, and abilities will stay growing as normal when energy (ATP) is fed.
- Most abilities cooldowns are now a bit faster to compensate the decrease when they are not fed.
- Added percentages of abilities in the HUD.
- Energytina Core now also influences how efficient the energy is held when an ability is not directly fed with energy, making abilities easier to be ready.

- Bone Nest buff. Before the damage multiplier was based in how low health the enemies were; now it also considers if their skin protection is low, making the ability more versatile against breakers or other ways of damaging skin/armor.
- Bones Nest Adrenaline now multiplies the damage by 2.

- Fixed some bugs with interactables

- Fixed some bugs with world generation tiles
