Tartarus Pit Season 5
Weâ€™re restarting the Tartarus Pit seasons! From now until November 16th, you have the chance to prove yourself as the best contender on the Tartarus Leaderboard.

The first-place champion will have their name immortalised in gold on the Entrance Tablets of the Tartarus Pit. The runner-up will also be honored, their name engraved in silver on the Second Tablet.

Go solo, form a team, or show off your most creative setups and masterfully engineered weapons.

Play fair, Hephaestus is watching.
