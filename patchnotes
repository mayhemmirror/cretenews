New patch in experimental CRETE, Remember to reset your Steam client to get the latest updates. 

You can always check the experimental version by doing this: Steam CRETE app > properties > Betas > and select "experimentalcrete"  so you can access the experimental branch. :kill: 

**IMPORTANT** You need to reapply your weapons in a weapon selector; otherwise, bugs may appear related to cooldowns.


- If an ability socket is not fully filled, now it will slowly decrease the charge until reaching 0. Abilities fully loaded will stay usable, and abilities will stay growing as normal when energy (ATP) is fed.
- Most abilities cooldowns are now a bit faster to compensate the decrease when they are not fed.
- Added percentages of abilities in the HUD.
- Energytina Core now also influences how efficient the energy is held when an ability is not directly fed with energy, making abilities easier to be ready.

- Weapons don't need to be reapplied to get the latest abilities updates
- Fixed a bug with ATP-ability build-up
- Velocitina Melee now has an impact on how fast you can cancel/dodge after succesfully hitting with Melee
- Fixed some bugs showing wrong numbers of abilities percentages
- Energytina Core now "Increases energy recovery, speeds up ability build-up and improves energy preservation."


- Bone Nest buff. Before the damage multiplier was based in how low health the enemies were; now it also considers if their skin protection is low, making the ability more versatile against breakers or other ways of damaging skin/armor.
- Bones Nest Adrenaline now multiplies the damage by 2.

- Fixed some bugs with interactables

- Fixed some bugs with world generation tiles
